# REPORTS (25 points)
Admin users can print two types of reports: a PDF for ALL records and an option to print only their records.
You should also have a report that is time-bound.
For ALL types of PDF reports, the following MUST be included.
1. The username of the currently logged in user.
2. The date and time the report was generated.
3. Pagination of all records for admin users. Incase there are hundreds of record that won't fit in a single page the records must be properly printed to the next page.
4. The current page / total pages (Page x of y)
5. All reports must be printed in landscape form. 
6. Include headers and footers from your web.xml to your PDF output.
7. For the list of users, provide atleast 50 records so that when the admin prints all of them you will be able to print all the list of users and roles only (DON'T print the passwords). Put an asterisk (*) beside the name of the currently logged in admin account.
8. The name of the PDF file should be based on the date and time stamp when the report was generated. Example:
COURSELIST_20240501081012.pdf 
2024 - year
05 - May
01 - May 1
08 - 8am
10 - 8:10am
12 - 8:10:12am
9. Be sure that the JSP will have a download link (or button) and should be downloaded on the client side and NOT the server side.
